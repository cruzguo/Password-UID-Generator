# Password-UID-Generator
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This is my first project after learning Java in my APCSA and CS1331 class. 
This project is a small, simple password and UID generator. Nothing fancy when it comes to presentation.
There is a couple features with this generator such as being able to choose the requirements a password must have and how long the passwords and UIDs must be with each compilation.
To run my code, simply copy and paste the code into a programming software compatible with Java and run the GeneratorTest file in a terminal!
